        Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form
        of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a
        contingent or uncertain loss. An entity which provides insurance is
        known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or
        underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an
        insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the
        insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the
        form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise
        to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may
        or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms,
        and usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable
        interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing
        relationship. The insured receives a contract, called the insurance
        policy, which details the conditions and circumstances under which the
        insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by
        the insurer to the policyholder for the coverage set forth in the
        insurance policy is called the premium. If the insured experiences a
        loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured
        submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a claims adjuster.
        The insurer may hedge its own risk by taking out reinsurance, whereby
        another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risks,
        especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to
        carry..

        Methods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by
        Chinese and Babylonian traders as long ago as the 3rd and 2nd
        millennia BC, respectively.[1] Chinese merchants travelling
        treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many
        vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel's capsizing. The
        Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous Code
        of Hammurabi, c. 1750 BC, and practiced by early Mediterranean sailing
        merchants. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he
        would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's
        guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen, or lost at
        sea. Circa 800 BC, the inhabitants of Rhodes created the 'general
        average'. This allowed groups of merchants to pay to insure their
        goods being shipped together. The collected premiums would be used to
        reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during transport,
        whether due to storm or sinkage.[2] The ancient Greeks had marine
        loans. Money was advanced on a ship or cargo, to be repaid with large
        interest if the voyage prosper, but not repaid at all if the ship be
        lost, the rate of interest being made high enough to pay not only for
        the use of the capital, but for the risk of losing it (fully described
        by Demosthenes). Loans of this character have ever since been common
        in maritime lands, under the name of bottomry and respondentia
        bonds.[3] The direct insurance of sea-risks for a premium paid
        independently of loans began, as far as is known, in Belgium about
        A.D. 1300.[3] Separate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies
        not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented in
        Genoa in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges
        of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from Genoa
        in 1347, and in the next century maritime insurance developed widely
        and premiums were intuitively varied with risks.[4] These new
        insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment,
        a separation of roles that first proved useful in marine insurance.
        The earliest known policy of life insurance was made in the Royal
        Exchange, London, on the 18th of June 1583, for Â£383, 6s. 8d. for
        twelve months, on the life of William Gibbons.[3]

        nsurance became far more sophisticated in Enlightenment era Europe, where specialized varieties developed.


        Lloyd's Coffee House was the first organized market for marine insurance.
        Property insurance as we know it today can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured more
        than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance "from a matter of
        convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in Sir Christopher Wren's inclusion of a site for
        'the Insurance Office' in his new plan for London in 1667."[5] A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came
        to nothing, but in 1681, economist Nicholas Barbon and eleven associates established the first fire insurance
        company, the "Insurance Office for Houses", at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes.
        Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his Insurance Office.[6]

        At the same time, the first insurance schemes for the underwriting of business ventures became available. By the
        end of the seventeenth century, London's growth as a centre for trade was increasing due to the demand for
        marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house, which became the meeting place for
        parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, including those willing to underwrite such
        ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance market Lloyd's of London and
        several related shipping and insurance businesses.[7]
